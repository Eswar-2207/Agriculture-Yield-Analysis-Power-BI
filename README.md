🌱 Smart Agriculture Farming Yield Analysis – Power BI
📊 Overview
This dashboard leverages Power BI to provide actionable insights into agricultural productivity by combining IoT sensor data, weather information, soil conditions, and crop yield statistics. It helps farmers, agronomists, and decision-makers optimize farming practices and improve overall yield.
🔑 Key Features
- Crop Yield Trends: Visualize historical and current yield data across different crops, seasons, and regions.
- Soil & Weather Insights: Integrate soil moisture, pH levels, and weather forecasts to understand environmental impacts on yield.
- IoT Sensor Monitoring: Track real-time data from smart devices (temperature, humidity, irrigation levels).
- Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning models embedded in Power BI to forecast future yields.
- Resource Utilization: Analyze fertilizer, pesticide, and water usage efficiency.
- Geospatial Mapping: Interactive maps showing yield distribution across fields or regions.
- Performance KPIs: Compare actual yield vs. expected yield, cost vs. revenue, and sustainability metrics.
🎯 Benefits
- Data-driven decisions: Farmers can plan sowing, irrigation, and harvesting more effectively.
- Cost optimization: Reduce waste of resources by identifying inefficiencies.
- Sustainability: Promote eco-friendly farming by monitoring environmental impact.
- Scalability: Adaptable for small farms or large-scale agribusiness operations.
